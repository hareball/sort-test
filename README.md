# sort-test
A sort benchmarking tool

Provides timing and memory usage for different sort algorithms against varied weighted data sets and sizes.
Useful to test performance of different sort algorithms against the same dataset.
Instructions provided for adding these to your own project, check out the sort algorithm source code.

Compiling: 
extract to a directory, type make

run sort-test in shell, i.e. ./sort-test

I've only tested this on ubuntu 18.04, but it (probably) runs on other linux versions.

Current sort algorithms:
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Gnome sort
* Comb sort
* Heap sort
* Quick sort
* Radix sort
* Tim sort
* Cycle sort
* Bitonic sort
